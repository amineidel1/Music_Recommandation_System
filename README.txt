# Music Recommendation System
## Introduction

This project develops a music recommendation system using a dataset that includes user listening patterns. The system analyzes user behavior to suggest songs that users might enjoy, enhancing their music listening experience.

# Installation and Setup

Dependencies
Ensure that Python is installed on your system. Then, install the required dependencies using the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

The requirements.txt file includes all necessary Python packages, such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, scikit-surprise, and streamlit.

How to Run the Project

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Launch the Streamlit application by running:

streamlit run app.py

# Project Approach

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Dataset Overview: The dataset includes columns like 'user', 'song', 'listen_count', 'title', 'release', 'artist_name', and 'year'.
EDA Objectives:
Identify the most listened to songs and popular artists.
Analyze user listening habits and song distribution.
Methods: The EDA involves visualizations (graphs and tables) to analyze the dataset, focusing on trends and patterns in music listening behavior.

# Recommendation Algorithm
